In this project, I will use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. 
Rather than work locally, I will work within AWS Sagemaker Studio.

This is the first submission for the Udacity nanodegree 'Machine Learning Fundamentals'. This is phase 3 of The AWS & Intel AI and Machine Learning Scholarship.
